# The values are the text params for each label in Random Forest frame options

N estimators: "Parameter information : The number of trees in the forest."

Criterion: "Parameter information : The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria are 'mse' for
the mean squared error, which is equal to variance reduction as feature selection criterion, and 'mae' for the
mean absolute error."

Max features: "Parameter information : The number of features to consider when looking for the best split"

Random state: "Parameter information : Controls both the randomness of the bootstrapping of the samples used when
building trees (if bootstrap=True) and the sampling of the features to consider when looking for the best split at
each node (if max_features < n_features)."

Window size: "Parameter information : The amount of records to look back for a prediction of one sample."

Threshold percent: "Parameter information : A value between 0 and 1. The value defines a percentage which is used to
find a numeric value of a threshold. The threshold is set to be a value greater than X% (chosen percentage) from
the total training prediction scores."
