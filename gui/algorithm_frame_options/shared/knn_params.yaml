  - "Neighbors number"

# The values are the keys of the parameters in the helper method file
# For example: 'frame.parameters[param_key] = frame.algorithm_param_combo'  (param_key is each value in the list)
# Moreover, the amount of values here should be same as the amount of values in the list above

# All the lists in the bottoms represent the values in each combobox which will be displayed.
# Should be: It is better that the keys of the lists will be informative but they can be every string you want
